# IMPORTANT: PRE-REQUISITES !

**PRE1 and PRE2 as prerequisites, and PRE4 is strongly recommended**. Note that **PRE1 and PRE2 are mandatory, i.e. you must attend them to be allowed to follow TC0/FPML**, except if you can argue that you are already very fluent in statistics (PRE1) and linear algebra (PRE2) (in that case, e-mail me).
**This class** (or an equivalent) **is a prerequisite for almost all other [AI] classes**.
