Gitlab for the course Fundamental Principles of Machine Learning (FPML or TC0) in the CS Masters (M1 year), in the track *Artificial Intelligence* of the Paris Saclay University

For now, only the contents related to the 1st class are online.

11/05 Update : corrections are online
11/05 Update : remember to take the quizz! it's at https://ecampus.paris-saclay.fr/course/view.php?id=28064#section-5  (then click to start the quizz)

Next time, the quizz will be opened and closed during the class, probably when we start the tutorial in small groups. You'll have approximately 10 min to take it.
