In the exam of 2020, exercises 1 and 4 account for lots of points (6 and 5).

They will be reduced in importance in 2021, in particulat, exercise 4, "Identifying the task, the appropriate classes of algos, and data structures/features" may be suppressed entirely. the exam will then be simply shorter.
