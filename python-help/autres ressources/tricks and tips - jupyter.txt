how to make sure jupyter's announced kernels correctly map to you correct python install

check out what's up with:
$ jupyter  kernelspec list
    Available kernels:
      python3    /home/flandes/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/python3
      python2    /home/flandes/miniconda2/share/jupyter/kernels/python2

$ cat ~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/python3/kernel.json
was reading like this:
    {
     "argv": [
      "python",
      "-m",
      "ipykernel_launcher",
      "-f",
      "{connection_file}"
     ],
     "display_name": "Python 3",
     "language": "python"
    }
But should read like this:
{
 "argv": [
  "python3",
  "-m",
  "ipykernel_launcher",
  "-f",
  "{connection_file}"
 ],
 "display_name": "Python 3",
 "language": "python"
}
   
Or vice versa (if you want to run python2 and note python3), you may epxlicitly write
